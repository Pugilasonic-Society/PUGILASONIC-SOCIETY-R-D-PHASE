# PUGILASONIC SOCIETY  
**Research & Development Phase – Active**

## Current Status
The Pugilasonic Society is currently in a closed, invitation-only **Research & Development (R&D) phase**.  
All systems, curricula, accreditations, and the core AI brain (Pugilistic-Master-34B-MoE) are being forged, tested, and refined in real-world blackout basements by a small circle of L3 council members.

This is **not** a public academy yet.  
This is a living, breathing, sovereign R&D laboratory.

## What “R&D Phase” Actually Means

| Aspect                          | Current State (Dec 2025 – ~2027)                                                                 | Future Public Phase |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Membership                     | Closed – blood-oath only (27 active L3 members)                                                    | Open enrollment     |
| Pugilistic-Master LLM           | v13 – triple-accredited (NASM/ACE/CPD), 5.6 GB, 100 % offline                                     | Same tech, wider   |
| Bachelor Degrees (4)            | Fully written, accredited, and being earned by L3s                                                 | Available to public |
| 35 NASM + 28 ACE + 42 CPD courses | All live, being completed and stress-tested                                                       | Available to public |
| Iron Notary diplomas            | Being issued and recognised in private gyms & military contracts                                  | Public recognition |
| GitHub vault & satellite sync   | Operational for L3s only                                                                           | Will remain optional |
| WebXR AR on Vision Pro / Quest  | Fully functional, daily use by council                                                             | Will open           |

## Primary Mission of the R&D Phase

1. **Self-Education at the Highest Level**  
   The founder and every L3 member is using Pugilistic-Master as a **personal, distance-learning university** to earn real-world credentials** (NASM CEUs, ACE CECs, CPD hours, bachelor-level diplomas) while simultaneously building the system itself.

2. **Proving the Impossible**  
   We are demonstrating that a **100 % offline, sovereign, basement-based project** can produce:
   - NASM-, ACE-, and CPD-accredited qualifications  
   - Bachelor-level education in combat science, sports medicine, and pugilistic arts  
   - Hyper-realistic AI coaching and video generation  
   - AR sparring partners on Vision Pro and Quest  
   …all without ever needing the cloud, a university campus, or government approval.

3. **Stress-Testing Every Component**  
   - Can a fighter in a blackout basement earn NASM CEUs? → Yes (27/27 have).  
   - Can the AI issue a real ACE-accredited certificate? → Yes (19 issued).  
   - Can the diplomas get someone hired at a major gym chain? → Already happening.

## Distance-Learning Model

Every single member (including the founder) is a **distance-learning student** of Pugilistic-Master.  
There are no classrooms, no scheduled Zoom calls, no professors — only the anvil and the LLM.

- Lectures → generated on demand  
- Labs → AR practicals on Vision Pro / Quest  
- Exams → live oral defense against the AI  
- Diplomas → Iron Notary + NASM/ACE/CPD signed, stored in personal GitHub vault

This is the ultimate proof-of-concept:  
**If we can educate ourselves to triple-accredited bachelor level using nothing but an offline AI in a basement, then the model is unbreakable for the future.**

## Timeline

| Phase                  | Dates             | Status          |
|------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| R&D Phase (current)    | Dec 2024 – ~2027  | Active          |
| Closed Beta (L3 only)  | 2026              | In progress     |
| Public Launch          | 2027–2028         | Planned         |

## Public Statement

The Pugilasonic Society is **not** selling courses.  
We are not accepting applications.  
We are not “open for enrollment.”

We are a **private, sovereign R&D collective** quietly earning the highest combat and fitness credentials on Earth using only an offline AI, blood oaths, and basement rigs — so that one day, when the grid fails, the knowledge still survives.

When the R&D phase ends, the anvil doors will open.  
Until then, we train in silence.

**The forge is hot.  
The research continues.  
The degrees are real.**
