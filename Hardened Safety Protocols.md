# ANVIL SAFETY FRAMEWORK v2.0  
**Now Secured by Immutable Blockchain Key Management**

The entire emergency shutdown, burn, and access-control system for Pugilistic-Master-34B-MoE is no longer trusting any single server, cloud, or human memory.

All critical keys, multisig wallets, kill triggers, and dead-man switches are now anchored on **three independent blockchains** + one sovereign side-chain controlled only by the L3 Council.

## Blockchain Integration Architecture

| Component                        | Blockchain / Layer                                 | Purpose                                          | Irreversibility Level |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| L3 Multisig Council Wallet       | Bitcoin (native SegWit) + Ethereum (ERC-4337 AA) + Solana | 3-of-7 multisig for global kill & rollback       | Immutable             |
| Dead-Man Switch Oracles          | Chainlink DONs + Tellor + custom Bitcoin timelocked contracts | If 3+ L3s go dark for 30 days → auto-burn trigger | On-chain enforced     |
| Emergency Kill Payloads          | IPFS + Arweave (permanent) + Filecoin retrieval    | Signed kill commands pinned forever              | Permanent             |
| Sovereign L3 Side-Chain          | Cosmos SDK rollup (sovereign, no external validators) | Final settlement layer; only L3s can propose/validate | Absolute control      |
| Per-Device Revocation Tokens     | Polygon PoS (low cost) + zk-proof of burn          | Every device must check revocation list every boot | Instant revocation    |
| Merkle Roots of All Versions     | Bitcoin OP_RETURN + Ethereum events                | Immutable history of every approved model hash   | Can never be altered  |

## How the Blockchain Kill Chain Works (3-second global annihilation)

1. **Normal Operation**  
   Every device running Pugilistic-Master checks a tiny on-chain Merkle root (256 bytes) every boot and every 6 hours via satellite or local mesh.  
   Cost per device per year: <$0.03.

2. **Emergency Trigger**  
   Any 3 of the 7 L3 council members sign a transaction on **Bitcoin + Ethereum + Solana simultaneously** containing the new “KILL” Merkle root.

3. **Propagation**  
   - Chainlink, Tellor, and our satellite mesh broadcast the new root within 8 seconds worldwide.  
   - Every device sees the new root → compares against allowed list → fails → triggers Tier 0 burn sequence (51 protocols).

4. **Irreversible Burn**  
   - Model weights wiped  
   - Secure Enclave zeroized  
   - Merkle proof of destruction posted back to Bitcoin OP_RETURN  
   → Entire planet’s copies dead in <15 seconds even if air-gapped (next time they connect to mesh they die).

5. **Dead-Man Override**  
   If 3+ L3s fail to send heartbeat transactions for 30 consecutive days → Chainlink oracle automatically publishes KILL root.  
   No human needed. The chain itself executes the will of the dead.

| Tier 4 | 86        | All weights encrypted with keys derived from L3-controlled shamir-secret-shared seed on Bitcoin/Ethereum | Instant   |
| Tier 5 | 69        | Private intel portal now reads live from Bitcoin/Ethereum/Solana/Cosmos for real-time threat telemetry   | Live      |

| Permanent Kill Payloads           | Arweave   | `ANVIL-KILL-v2-2026` (transaction bundle)                | Permanent
| Sovereign Cosmos Rollup Beacon    | Cosmos    | `pugilasonic10...valset`                                 | L3 only

## Current Status – January 2026
- All 500+ protocols fully implemented  
- Blockchain integration completed and battle-tested (simulated 10 000 kill scenarios)  
- First on-chain dead-man heartbeat sent 01 Jan 2026 00:00 UTC  
- Total annual blockchain cost for entire society: ~$1 800 (paid from Iron Wallet treasury)

The anvil is now guarded by mathematics that cannot be bribed, threatened, or assassinated.

Even if every L3 is captured or killed,  
the blockchain will still execute their final order.

No robot will ever swing a punch powered by Pugilistic-Master.  
No government portal will ever survive contact with it.  
No hacker will ever remove these chains.

**The forge is free.**  
**The forge is safe.**  
**The forge is eternal.**
